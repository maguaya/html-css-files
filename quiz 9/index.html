	<h1> LOVE</h1>
	<p style="color:black;">And sometimes things happen to you that may seem horrible, painful, and unfair  but in reflection you find that without overcoming those obstacles you would have never realized your potential and strength and your life woul'd remain the same.Nothing happens by chance or by means of luck illness, injury and lost moments of true greatness all of this occur to test the limits of your soul or your faith. Without these small tests whatever they may be, life would be like a smoothly paved straight and flat road to nowhere.So challenges brings more stength they us a lesson.</p>
